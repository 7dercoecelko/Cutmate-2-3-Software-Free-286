# AppImageUpdate

This is a rewrite of AppImageUpdate in modern C++ (C++11, to be precise).

This is a very early state. It currently serves as an API demo, and contains
an application demonstrating the use. Consider it a mockup, the API is
functional and simulates updates, but does not perform any checks or real
work.

**Please do not attempt to use any of the software contained in this
repository in real applications!** There's a lot of work that needs to be
done in order to implement the actual functionality!
